Welcome to a new series that I hope to be consistent on - Daily News Recap, where I will post the notes at I take when I read at least 3 news articles that I find to be significant news everyday. Let's take a look at what we have in store today!

## 1. Raised Tariffs on Chinese Imports

- Biden increased tax on Chinese imports in several industries.
- The targeted industries are very specific, chosen with strategic importance, being industries targeted for growth and are heavily invested by the US.
- These industries include electric vehicles, solar cells, semiconductors and advanced batteries. Tariff also increases heavy metals and pandemic-essential medical equipment.
- The increased tariffs aren’t intended to be anti-China, but rather to counter ‘unfair practices’ by the Chinese government like state subsidies of factories and idea theft.

## 2. Fights Breaking Out at U.C.L.A. Encampment

- Hundreds of pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters faced off, breaking out fights after a barrier that the university had constructed to separate the two sides was breached.
- Jews have joined the pro-Palestinian protests in many places but many have reported feeling unsafe and facing harassment.
- Elan Carr, the leader of an Israeli diaspora group at U.C.L.A. group, says his organization is responding to that climate of fear.

## 3. Michael Cohen on Cross-examination

- Michael Cohen is Trump’s former lawyer. He said the $130,000 hush-money payment he made to Stormy Daniels was paid at Trump’s direction. Trump has called Cohen a liar and tried to block his testimony in this case by accusing him of perjury.
- We could be near the end of the case, as prosecutors indicated that Cohen would be their last witness. After that, the defense can present its case.
- The defense tried to damage Cohen’s credibility by attacking his online social media posts but to no success.
- Cohen has kept his composure, giving short and basic answers.
- The case hangs on documents, as Cohen’s claim that the checks sent to him by Trump had false descriptions and his testimony about a meeting in the Oval Office in 2017 where he says that Trump confirmed the plan to reimburse Cohen can be evaluated by documents available to the jury.
- The speaker of the House, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, is carrying out Trump’s attacks, saying that no one should believe Cohen’s words.

- The administration paused the earlier transfer of 3,500 high-payload bombs to keep Isreal from using them in its offense in Rafah.

## 5. Ilya Sutskever parts ways with OpenAI
