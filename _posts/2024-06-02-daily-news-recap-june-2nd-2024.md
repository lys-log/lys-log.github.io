Hi all! Welcome back to the Daily News Recap - a series where I share significant points from at least 3 news articles every day! In recent days, the college application process has caught up to me, making it harder and harder for me to remain consistent on this series. There will be certain times when I’ll have to heavily focus on other stuff, but this remains one of my favorite hobbies, I’ll try my best to spend at least 30 minutes every day to at least recap 1 or 2 articles. I’m still reading the news everyday, so let’s hope I’ll continue getting great scores on the NYTimes weekly news quiz. Enough chit-chatting, let’s get straight to today’s headlines!

## 1. Washington Post Editor Steps Down

- Matt Murray, former editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal, will take her place temporarily.
- Robert Winnett, a deputy editor of the Telegraph Media Group, will take over after the election.
- In 2023, the Post lost more than $70 million and suffered a substantial decline in audience.

## 3. South Africa Election - What's Next?

- The African National Congress (ANC) won only about 40 percent of the vote in last week’s election, which means it is now negotiating with rival parties to be partners in forming a government.
- The ANC has governed since the start of democracy in South Africa in 1994.
- Officials with the ANC have said that they want their leader, Cyril Ramaphosa, to continue for a second term.
- South Africa is facing two possibilities:
  - The ANC will remain governing, which means little will be done to fix the nation’s poverty, joblessness, crime, and inequality.
  - Whoever enters the national government will aggressively address those problems.

## 4. Philadelphia’s University of the Arts Announces Closure

- The university will close on June 7.
- It has faced financial struggles, a decline in enrollments and revenues, and increasing expenses.
- The university couldn’t “identify a viable path to remain open and in the service of its mission”.
