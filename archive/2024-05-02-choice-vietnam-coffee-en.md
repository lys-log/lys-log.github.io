It’s a beautiful Thursday morning when Sai Gon’s flaming weather has cooled down a bit, so I decided to have a try at a new coffee shop in District 1. Lost in the abundance of coffee shops in the district, I decided to head to Choice Fresh Coffee & Tea at [9 Cong Truong Lam Son, Ben Nghe, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City](https://goo.gl/maps/nFMi1oyRQGdtVMCv7).

The coffee is located right next to Cong Truong Lam Son, in a little corner of Sai Gon where little traffic resides. I was a little afraid to go to the shop as Google says the shop opens until 12 AM (silly me thought that meant noon), but the shop actually opens 24/7!

I went to the shop wanting a comfortable place to study, so I spent 45,000VND for a Vietnamese Condensed Milk Coffee and 35,000VND for a donut, which both tasted amazing! Though I didn’t interact much with the staff, they were very friendly and nice to me, and the service was really fast. The price is a little much for regular students like me, but considering the size and the quality of the coffee and the donut, this sum of money makes sense to me. Well, the good thing is that the full menu is uploaded to the shop website (it's not an HTTPS link so I cannot link it for security sake), so feel free to have a look before visiting!

By 11 AM, the shop went from having 4 customers to more than a dozen. Most of the chairs are huge leather chairs, with short, small tables and about 2-3 electrical outlets per table. With a very chill, fresh atmosphere and pretty decors, I’d say Choice Coffee makes more sense for chatting with friends rather than studying. Studying here so far has still been decent, though the table only has enough space for my laptop (and a mouse if you really want to squeeze it in), but I’ll have to say that the music choice of the shop is immaculate (for studying of course)!

_Introvert test: **Passed** - The shop put the wifi password on the bill!_

Overall, I’ll give Choice Coffee a **7.5/10** studying-wise. I think D1 has plenty of options that would be better for studying, but for anyone looking to just relax and have a good time with pals, Choice Vietnam would be an option that I consider!

That’s all from me, gotta continue studying :)
